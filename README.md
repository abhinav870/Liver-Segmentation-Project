- Using PyTorch and MONAI created an Image Segmentation Model that segments the human liver from a Public CT SCAN Dataset.
- Algorithm/Techniques Used: 3D U-net Architecture, Data Transforms, Data Augmentation.
- Result- Achieved 50% faster convergence and less dice loss as compared to other pre-trained models
